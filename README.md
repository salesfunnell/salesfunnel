Sales Funnel is an enterprise-grade D2M (Direct-to-Market) platform designed to eliminate supply chain friction by connecting wholesalers directly to key distributors. Our mission is to democratize access to factory-gate pricing and establish a new standard for fulfillment speed in the African market.





Our Vision
We are transforming the traditional procurement process into a transparent, digital ecosystem where trust is built through accountability and real-time tracking.


The Framework

Direct Procurement: Wholesalers access real-time catalogs and transparent pricing to place bulk orders by the case.


Integrated Payments: Secure bank transfer workflows with automated reconciliation to ensure financial integrity.



The 2-Hour SLA: A mandatory operational commitment requiring distributors to package and prepare goods within 120 minutes of payment approval.



Secure Handshake: A 4-digit verification system that secures physical delivery and creates an immutable audit trail for every transaction.

Technical Implementation

Frontend: A React-based Progressive Web App (PWA) optimized for mobile-first, high-traffic market environments with a low tech barrier.


Backend: Engineered by Antigravity, featuring real-time payment verification, automated status notifications, and fulfillment timing logic.


Sales Funnel is more than an application; it is a commitment to a more efficient, transparent, and accountable future for commerce.
